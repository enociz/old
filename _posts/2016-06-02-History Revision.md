# History Revision

#### Brought to you by your friend at Yink Co.

## 1) Evolution, Life, Charles Darwin theory

### Life
- What was our purpose?
- Every organism is a self or being
- To be one of these, you need to self-generate and self-maintain
- **Self-generation** the making of a self through cell division or taking te part from a new born to old age. Key players are proteins, which folds up into compplex shapes and do two major things: interact with other proteins and to serve as enzymes that allow chemical reactions inside the cell to take place.
- **Self-maintenance** obtaining the molecules and energy to metabolise (via photosynthesis or ingesting things made as a results of photosynthesis). It also involves self-protection and avoiding hazards such as predators and/or disease.
- Every organism is instructed via the genes that make up the proteins
- Every organism can evolve through "mistakes" or mutation
- Every organism has purpose and is directed by a goal, whether to survive and thrive, or to ace a History exam. Nonlifes such as mountains don't have a purpose and just are

#### How Life Started

- Around 4 billion years ago life first appeared deep in the ocean as bacteria due to chemical reactions. These bacteria cells would soon evolve into prokaryotes (single celled organisms).
- After time these cells would go closer to the ocean surface hence developing the ability to perform photosynthesis.
- Some of these bacteria cells had a genetic mutation where they turned into multi celled organisms or eukaryotes.
- These cells would evolve into small fish and coral and eventually reptiles. Reptiles tried to go to land but needed water to reproduce until they discovered that they can lay eggs meaning they could stay on land. These reptiles would evolve into dinosaurs eventually while some turned into mammals.
- After the dinosaurs extinction, mammals were allowed to come out and rule over the lands, evolving into the creatures we see today. Humans evolved around 4 million years ago from our closest ancestor, the chimpanzee.

### Evolution

#### Mini Thresholds:
- photosynthesis
- eukaryotes
- multicelled organisms
- brains
- land
- mammals

### Darwin

#### Theory

- A species is a population of organisms that interbreeds and has fertile offspring.
- Living organisms have descended with modifications from species that lived before them.
- Natural selection explains how this evolution has happened:
  - More organisms are produced than can survive because of limited resources.
  - Organisms struggle for the necessities of life; there is competition for resources.
  - Individuals within a population vary in their traits; some of these traits are heritable -- passed on to offspring.
  - Some variants are better adapted to survive and reproduce under local conditions than others.
  - Better-adapted individuals (the "fit enough") are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing on copies of their genes to the next generation.
  - Species whose individuals are best adapted survive; others become extinct.

#### Religion and Evolution (from Prof. John Haught)
- **Conflict**: views are in total conflict
- **Contrast**: the evolution and religion answer totally different questions, so they can’t be in conflict
- **Convergence**: truth in both views, so the two must ultimately be truthful.

#### Key Key Terms

- **Theory of Evolution**- All life is related to one common ancestor but over time species have 'modified' themselves to be better suited to their environment and carry specific traits. Meaning complex creatures evolved from more simplistic ones naturally over time.

- **Theory of Evolution (natural selection)** - As time went by, Different species of animals adopted to their environment through genetic mutation to survive for longer and produce more offspring, these genes would be passed on to their offspring so they would be better suited to their environment while the other animals would struggle to survive and reproduce and eventually die out. 

- **Natural selection** - This is 'survival of the fittest' when a certain species of animal naturally goes through genetic mutation to obtain new traits to be better suited to their environment, survive for longer and reproduce more. 

### Threshold card

```
Ingredients and Conditions – Complex chemical compunds, right amount of energy, liquid qater

New complexity – New organisms with ability to metabolise (survive), homeostasify (adjust), reproduce (thrive), and evolve (adapt).
```

## 2) Early Humans

After the extinction of the dinosaurs, the rise of humans began. In relation to Darwin's theory of evolution we evolved from chimps **4 million** years ago as **AUSTRALOPITHECUS** then turned into **HOMO HABILIS 2.2 million years ago**, then **HOMO ERECTUS (ERGASTER) 1.8 million years ago** when we became *bipedal*, **NEANDERTHAL around 600,000 years ago** and eventually **HOMO SAPIENS 250,000 years ago**. Each of our ancestors carried certain traits but as they evolved into humans they got taller, their skeletal and body structure changed and we had larger brains.

### Threshold card

```
Ingredients - Powerful brains + precise and versatile symbolic language.

Goldilocks Conditions - interactions between individuals and communities.

New complexity - humans + the use of collective learning 
```

## 3) Human Migration [Map analysis and questions]

### Out of Africa

### Collective Learning
- The process of developing and improving techniques and ideas through the involvement of more than one person.
- Farming speeds up the pace of this by giving people more free time
- Networks both in the civilisation, and through trade allowed spread and improvement of ideas and techniques

## 4) Guns, Germs, and Steel

### Where and when did the first agrarian civilisations start?

- Around 11,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent (Middle East) nomadic groups came together to begin a new era where they would change their nomadic ways to a more sedentary lifestyle.
- People would interact with each other which made them agree to work together as a group to gain more resources.
- After time these groups increased in populations to create the first civilisations.
- These civilisations developed a new form of gaining resources called farming where instead of physically killing an animal and looking for plants, they would domesticate and grow their own using new technology.
- After time, the Fertile Crescents resources started to become more scarce, this caused people to mice out of this region and started human migration.
- People migrated east or west due to similar climate and the same agriculture. After more civilisations were established people created new foundations of society for example religion and new technology.

- The first agrarian civilizations developed in about **3200 BCE**. These early farming societies started in three areas: **Mesopotamia**; in **Egypt and Nubia (now northern Sudan)**; and in the **Indus Valley**. More appeared in **China** a bit later and in **Central America** and along the **Andes Mountains** of South America at about 2000 — 1000 BCE. 

**Plants first domesticated**: Lentils and Barley

**Animals first domesticated**: cows, dogs, sheep, goat, horses, oxen etc.

**First known big city**: Uruk, located in Mesopotamia (Fertile Crescent)

**Where did humans first start**: Africa then moved out around 60,000 years ago

#### Threshold card

```
Ingredients - Knowledge about the environment + Increasingly dense human populations 

Goldilocks Conditions - Increasing competition for resources + Warmer climates after the last ice age

New complexity - Domestication of plants and animals + development of villages, cities and agrarian civilisations
```

### How do they function/Key features
Characteristics that made a civilisations were:
- agrarian surplus
- more trade
- cities
- monumental architecture
- governments and social hierarchies (esp. religious & a central ruler; division of jobs, divisions based on birth, wealth and job)
- farming (esp. Agrarian, which relied on a water source as well)
- tax systems
- armies/wars
- writing

### Jared Diamond's theory

Although the tribes in Papau New Guinea can adapt and do everything that everone else can, they are not as modern as Americans. This is a direct result of geographical unluckiness.

#### Geographical Luck

Different zones have different characteristics that effected its success. Eg: the big 4 (cows, pigs, sheep, goats) were all from Middle East.

## 5) How did people go from being hunter gatherers to Agrarian Civilisations?

Our ancestors originally lived as hunter-gatherers in small groups and were nomadic. These people would soon go on to take the next step in the course of Big History - the development and rise of Agriculture.

### Foraging

- **Foraging** means relying on food provided by nature through the gathering of plants and small animals, birds, and insects; scavenging animals killed by other predators; and hunting.
- Our verbal and non-verbal communication skills aided collective learning in improving processes (may have lead to development of agriculture
_ THe use of fire, beginning a distinguishing feature of *Homo Sapiens* and cooking with it provided nutrition, look less energy to chew, allowed for smaller intestines, and thus helped brain development. Eating around a fire probably helped communication, empathy, and collective learning, to develop.
- Probably scavenged at first, but used weapons etc. to get better and endure longer
- Development of social order through hunter-gatherer societies which lead to civilisations

***Also refer to Q4***


## Key Terms

- **Complexity**: the quality or condition of something that has diverse ingredients in precise arrangement one after the other, to create new emergent properties that weren't there before.
- **Simplicity**: the quality or condition of how easily understood and uncomplicated something is.
- **Collective learning**: Unlike other mammals humans are able to perform collective learning, a process where when knowledge and information is passed down through generations and improved, tinkered with and perfected to make it better. An example of collective learning are the tools are ancestors used like an axe, they improved on it so it could benefit them more.
- **Foraging**: Once people could communicate with each other it meant they could share ideas and knowledge to create new things like tools for example. From 200,000-11,000 years ago people used a form of finding resources and food called 'Foraging' which solely relied on hunting and gathering food from nature to survive. The methods used for hunting animals are for example chasing them, though humans could not run faster, they could run for longer so they used this to their advantage until they became more sedentary when agriculture developed.
- **Civilisations**: A civilisation is a complex society, characterised by urban development, social stratification and symbolic communication (i.e. writing).
- **Foraging**: relying on food provided by nature through the gathering
of plants and small animals, birds, and insects; scavenging animals killed by
other predators; and hunting. 
- A “**city**” contains tens of thousands of people. It’s larger than a **town** which contains only thousands of people. A **village** is made of just hundreds. In cities, people had **specific jobs**. They weren’t all farmers. The food they ate was grown by farmers nearby.
- A “**state**” is a city, or several cities, and the surrounding villages and farms. A state could include hundreds of thousands of **people**, even millions. There were **levels of power and wealth**. A few people called “**elites**” were on top. Elites typically made up no more than one-tenth of the population. Yet, they had more wealth and power than the bottom nine-tenths combined. States were **ruled** by these elites. They controlled the **military**. And they might use force to keep order and collect **taxes**.

## Acknowledgements

Today we stand in footsteps millennia old. May we acknowledge the traditional owners whose cultures and customs have nurtured, and continue to nurture, this land, since men and women awoke from the great dream. We honour the presence of these ancestors who reside in the imagination of this land and whose irrepressible spirituality flows through all creation.
