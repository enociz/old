# History Revision

#### Brought to you by your friend at Yink Co.

## 1) Evolution, Life, Charles Darwin theory

### Life
- What was our purpose?
- Every organism is a self or being
- To be one of these, you need to self-generate and self-maintain
- **Self-generation** the making of a self through cell division or taking te part from a new born to old age. Key players are proteins, which folds up into compplex shapes and do two major things: interact with other proteins and to serve as enzymes that allow chemical reactions inside the cell to take place.
- **Self-maintenance** obtaining the molecules and energy to metabolise (via photosynthesis or ingesting things made as a results of photosynthesis). It also involves self-protection and avoiding hazards such as predators and/or disease.
- Every organism is instructed via the genes that make up the proteins
- Every organism can evolve through "mistakes" or mutation
- Every organism has purpose and is directed by a goal, whether to survive and thrive, or to ace a History exam. Nonlifes such as mountains don't have a purpose and just are

### Evolution

#### Mini Thresholds:
- photosynthesis
- eukaryotes
- multicelled organisms
- brains
- land
- mammals

### Darwin

#### Theory

- A species is a population of organisms that interbreeds and has fertile offspring.
- Living organisms have descended with modifications from species that lived before them.
- Natural selection explains how this evolution has happened:
  - More organisms are produced than can survive because of limited resources.
  - Organisms struggle for the necessities of life; there is competition for resources.
  - Individuals within a population vary in their traits; some of these traits are heritable -- passed on to offspring.
  - Some variants are better adapted to survive and reproduce under local conditions than others.
  - Better-adapted individuals (the "fit enough") are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing on copies of their genes to the next generation.
  - Species whose individuals are best adapted survive; others become extinct.

#### Religion and Evolution (from Prof. John Haught)
- **Conflict**: views are in total conflict
- **Contrast**: the evolution and religion answer totally different questions, so they canâ€™t be in conflict
- **Convergence**: truth in both views, so the two must ultimately be truthful.
