## 1) Evolution, Life, Charles Darwin theory

### Life
- What was our purpose?
- Every organism is a self or being
- To be one of these, you need to self-generate and self-maintain
- **Self-generation** the making of a self through cell division or taking te part from a new born to old age. Key players are proteins, which folds up into compplex shapes and do two major things: interact with other proteins and to serve as enzymes that allow chemical reactions inside the cell to take place.
- **Self-maintenance** obtaining the molecules and energy to metabolise (via photosynthesis or ingesting things made as a results of photosynthesis). It also involves self-protection and avoiding hazards such as predators and/or disease.
- Every organism is instructed via the genes that make up the proteins
- Every organism can evolve through "mistakes" or mutation
- Every organism has purpose and is directed by a goal, whether to survive and thrive, or to ace a History exam. Nonlifes such as mountains don't have a purpose and just are
