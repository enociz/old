# History Revision

#### Brought to you by your friend at Yink Co.

## 1) Evolution, Life, Charles Darwin theory

### Life
- What was our purpose?
- Every organism is a self or being
- To be one of these, you need to self-generate and self-maintain
- **Self-generation** the making of a self through cell division or taking te part from a new born to old age. Key players are proteins, which folds up into compplex shapes and do two major things: interact with other proteins and to serve as enzymes that allow chemical reactions inside the cell to take place.
- **Self-maintenance** obtaining the molecules and energy to metabolise (via photosynthesis or ingesting things made as a results of photosynthesis). It also involves self-protection and avoiding hazards such as predators and/or disease.
- Every organism is instructed via the genes that make up the proteins
- Every organism can evolve through "mistakes" or mutation
- Every organism has purpose and is directed by a goal, whether to survive and thrive, or to ace a History exam. Nonlifes such as mountains don't have a purpose and just are

#### How Life Started

- Around 4 billion years ago life first appeared deep in the ocean as bacteria due to chemical reactions. These bacteria cells would soon evolve into prokaryotes (single celled organisms).
- After time these cells would go closer to the ocean surface hence developing the ability to perform photosynthesis.
- Some of these bacteria cells had a genetic mutation where they turned into multi celled organisms or eukaryotes.
- These cells would evolve into small fish and coral and eventually reptiles. Reptiles tried to go to land but needed water to reproduce until they discovered that they can lay eggs meaning they could stay on land. These reptiles would evolve into dinosaurs eventually while some turned into mammals.
- After the dinosaurs extinction, mammals were allowed to come out and rule over the lands, evolving into the creatures we see today. Humans evolved around 4 million years ago from our closest ancestor, the chimpanzee.

### Evolution

#### Mini Thresholds:
- photosynthesis
- eukaryotes
- multicelled organisms
- brains
- land
- mammals

### Darwin

#### Theory

- A species is a population of organisms that interbreeds and has fertile offspring.
- Living organisms have descended with modifications from species that lived before them.
- Natural selection explains how this evolution has happened:
  - More organisms are produced than can survive because of limited resources.
  - Organisms struggle for the necessities of life; there is competition for resources.
  - Individuals within a population vary in their traits; some of these traits are heritable -- passed on to offspring.
  - Some variants are better adapted to survive and reproduce under local conditions than others.
  - Better-adapted individuals (the "fit enough") are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing on copies of their genes to the next generation.
  - Species whose individuals are best adapted survive; others become extinct.

#### Religion and Evolution (from Prof. John Haught)
- **Conflict**: views are in total conflict
- **Contrast**: the evolution and religion answer totally different questions, so they canâ€™t be in conflict
- **Convergence**: truth in both views, so the two must ultimately be truthful.

#### Key Key Terms

- **Theory of Evolution**- All life is related to one common ancestor but over time species have 'modified' themselves to be better suited to their environment and carry specific traits. Meaning complex creatures evolved from more simplistic ones naturally over time.

- **Theory of Evolution (natural selection)** - As time went by, Different species of animals adopted to their environment through genetic mutation to survive for longer and produce more offspring, these genes would be passed on to their offspring so they would be better suited to their environment while the other animals would struggle to survive and reproduce and eventually die out. 

- **Natural selection** - This is 'survival of the fittest' when a certain species of animal naturally goes through genetic mutation to obtain new traits to be better suited to their environment, survive for longer and reproduce more. 

## 2) Early Humans

After the extinction of the dinosaurs, the rise of humans began. In relation to Darwin's theory of evolution we evolved from chimps **4 million** years ago as **AUSTRALOPITHECUS** then turned into **HOMO HABILIS 2.2 million years ago**, then **HOMO ERECTUS (ERGASTER) 1.8 million years ago** when we became *bipedal*, **NEANDERTHAL around 600,000 years ago** and eventually **HOMO SAPIENS 250,000 years ago**. Each of our ancestors carried certain traits but as they evolved into humans they got taller, their skeletal and body structure changed and we had larger brains.

## 3) Human Migration [Map analysis and questions]

### Out of Africa

### Collective Learning

## 4) Guns, Germs, and Steel

### Where and when did the first agrarian civilisations start?

### How do they function/Key features

## 5) How did people go from being hunter gatherers to Agrarian Civilisations?

#### Foraging

## Key Terms

- **Complexity** - the quality or condition of something that has diverse ingredients in precise arrangement one after the other, to create new emergent properties that weren't there before.

- **Simplicity** - the quality or condition of how easily understood and uncomplicated something is.

## Acknowledgements

Today we stand in footsteps millennia old. May we acknowledge the traditional owners whose cultures and customs have nurtured, and continue to nurture, this land, since men and women awoke from the great dream. We honour the presence of these ancestors who reside in the imagination of this land and whose irrepressible spirituality flows through all creation.
